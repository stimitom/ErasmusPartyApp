# ErasmusPartyApp

ErasmusPartyApp was an Android App available at the Google Play Store.
The app was designed for people in my Erasmus destination called Kaunas, a city in Lithuania ðŸ‡±ðŸ‡¹. 
People could see the local Pubs, Bars and Night Clubs and Check In , if they were there. Other users could then see how many people from which country were at each place.

At its short peak it looked something like this: 
![Starting Screen](image url "image Title")
![All Bars](image url "image Title")
![One Bar](image url "image Title")

Due to some problems with maintenance and most important, me moving on to other things, the app is not functional anymore. 
You can still download it, but you won't find it very useful.

Erasmus Party App was my first real project ever. I coded it without any knowledge about program structure or good practices.
The app is nearly entirely running in the front-end on the users' phones. 
I used google firebase as my database and some google cloud functions for updating the the data everyday.

I am sure this project is full of ridiculous mistakes but still, feel free to check it out :).
